# covid_tweets
This is a final assignment of the data analysis course that I take, "Computing for Social Sciences (MAVA 354)" at Koç University by Ali Hürriyetoğlu.

The project aims to explore, clear, filter and label some data taken from coronovirus tweets on May 17th, 2020. The code identifies usernames and urls, most tweeted words, tweet lengths, longest and shortest words, most frequently used hashtags, some histograms to visualize data, and whether a tweet is retweeted or nor.

The code is written in Juptyper Notebook.
